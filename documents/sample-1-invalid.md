### 1. Introduction

With the advancements in AI and machine learning, our competitors have been successfully implementing image recognition into they're services. We are been left behind and hence, we believe the integration of an image recognition feature into our website is crucial for maintaining competitive advantage.

---

### 2. Background

Currently, users uploads images to our website without any system to identify the content of those images. By integrating image recognition, images will be automatically categorized, which offers users a richer browsing experience.

---

### 3. Goals

- Allow users to have there images automatically categorized.
- Reduce the manpower required for manually sorting and tagging images.
- Enhance user engagement on the website.

---

### 4. Proposed Solution

The proposed solution is integrating an image recognition API. The following steps is proposed:

1. Research and select a suitable image recognition API.
2. Develop the integration code and modules.
3. Testing will be carried out by the QA team.
4. Once approved, deployment will be done to the live website.

---

### 5. Potential Challenges

- The accuracy of image recognition is not always 100%. Mis-categorizations can occur.
- Costs associated with using third-party APIs might rise as our usage increases.
- The user's response to this new feature is unpredictable.

---

### 6. Feedback Requested

The community is requested to provide feedback on:

- The choice of image recognition API.
- Any potential challenges not identified in this document.
- Suggestions to improve user experience after implementation.

---

### 7. Timeline

- Research and selection of API: By October 10
- Development phase: October 11-20
- Testing phase: October 21-27
- Deployment: By October 31

---

### 8. Conclusion

In conclusion, the integration of image recognition into our website seems to be a valuable addition. Feedbacks and suggestions will be essential to ensure its successful implementation and adoption by our users.
